Small open models fine-tuned for competitive programming, trained on free GPUs.
Part of [NiLabs](https://nilabs.dev) &mdash; project page at [nilabs.dev/ladder](https://nilabs.dev/ladder).

Ladder is a QLoRA fine-tuning and evaluation pipeline for Codeforces-style
problems. It is built around one constraint: **everything has to run on a free
Kaggle or Colab T4.** That rules out full fine-tuning, bf16, and flash-attention,
and it drives most of the design decisions below.

The eval is verifiable. Models are not scored by another model, by BLEU against a
reference solution, or by whether the output looks like code. A generated program
is run against the problem's actual test cases, and it either passes them or it
does not.

> **Status:** the pipeline runs end to end and an adapter exists. There is still
> no publishable number. The first base-vs-tuned evaluation was **inconclusive**
> for a diagnosed reason and is being re-run. The results table below stays empty
> until a defensible measurement replaces it, and what has been run so far is
> written up in [Results](#results) rather than left out.

## What it does

```
open-r1/codeforces-cots  ──build-data──▶  train.jsonl / val.jsonl
                                                │
                                                ├──train──▶  LoRA adapter
                                                │
held-out problems + tests  ─────────eval────────┴──▶  pass@k
```

- **Data** — [`open-r1/codeforces-cots`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-r1/codeforces-cots),
  the `solutions_py_decontaminated` config: Codeforces problems with reasoning
  traces, decontaminated against common benchmarks. Each row also carries public,
  private, and generated test cases, which is what makes the eval verifiable
  without a second dataset — and what makes the filtering below possible.
- **Verified training data** — the traces are model-generated, so some of them
  are wrong. Every trace's solution is run against its own problem's tests during
  data prep, and the failures are dropped. See below.
- **Training** — 4-bit QLoRA via [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)
  on `Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct`. Loss is computed on the assistant turn only.
- **Eval** — generate a program, run it against up to 20 test cases in a
  subprocess with time and memory limits, report pass@k.

## The training data is not all correct

The reasoning traces in `codeforces-cots` are model output, not verified
solutions. Running them against the problems' own test cases:

| Sample | Traces whose solution actually passes |
| --- | --- |
| Easy problems (div2 A/B) | 16/16 |
| Mixed sample including div1 D/E/G/H | 36/50 |

Every failure was a wrong answer on a hard problem, not a crash or a timeout —
these are confident, well-structured, incorrect solutions, and they are
concentrated on exactly the problems worth learning from.

`verify_solutions: true` (on by default in both shipped configs) runs the eval's
judge across the training set during data prep and drops the traces that fail.
It costs about eight minutes of CPU for the full corpus and no GPU time at all,
since data prep runs before you ever start a GPU session.

Problems where exact-match judging cannot decide correctness — Codeforces
`checker` problems with many valid outputs, and problems shipping no tests — are
kept rather than discarded, since failing them would throw away correct traces
for being right in a different way. Set `verify_keep_unverifiable: false` to
train on the verified subset only.

## Quickstart

Data prep is CPU-only, so do it first and do it anywhere:

```bash
pip install -e .
ladder build-data --config configs/smoke-1.5b.yaml --out data/smoke
```

Then on a GPU box:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-train.txt
ladder train --config configs/smoke-1.5b.yaml --data data/smoke
ladder eval  --config configs/smoke-1.5b.yaml --adapter outputs/smoke-1.5b
```

`configs/smoke-1.5b.yaml` is a 20-step run on a 1.5B base. It exists to prove the
whole pipeline works end to end in about fifteen minutes, **before** you spend
free GPU hours on `configs/ladder-3b-t4.yaml`. Run it first.

### Running the real thing on Kaggle

Kaggle's free tier has an API, so the whole run is scriptable — push, poll,
collect. No notebook to babysit:

```bash
pip install kaggle          # credentials: kaggle.com/settings -> API -> Create New Token
python scripts/kaggle_run.py --user <your-kaggle-username>
```

That pushes [`kaggle/ladder_kernel.py`](kaggle/ladder_kernel.py), which runs
data prep, evaluates the untouched base model, trains, evaluates the fine-tune,
and prints both numbers. It polls until the kernel finishes and downloads the
results.

The kernel writes each stage's outcome to `status.json` as it goes, so a session
that hits Kaggle's 12-hour cap still leaves behind the base number and the
trained adapter rather than nothing. `configs/ladder-3b-kaggle.yaml` is sized to
land inside that cap with margin.

[`notebooks/kaggle_ladder.ipynb`](notebooks/kaggle_ladder.ipynb) is the same
pipeline as a notebook, if you would rather watch it run.

## Commands

| Command | GPU | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ladder build-data` | no | Streams and filters the source dataset into JSONL |
| `ladder train` | yes | QLoRA SFT; `--max-steps` for a smoke run |
| `ladder eval` | yes | Generate and judge; omit `--adapter` to score the base model |
| `ladder judge` | no | Rescore saved generations without reloading a model |
| `ladder show-config` | no | Print the fully resolved config |

`build-data` is where verification happens, which is why it is the slow CPU step
and why it is worth running once and reusing the JSONL across training runs.

Every knob lives in `configs/*.yaml`, and an unrecognized key is an error rather
than a silent no-op — a typo'd `learning_rat` should not cost you a four-hour run.

## Results

### The adapter exists

One adapter has been trained. Every number here is measured, from
[`results/2026-08-19-train/`](results/2026-08-19-train/).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Base | `unsloth/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct-bnb-4bit` |
| Data | 2,271 train / 85 val, every trace verified by execution |
| Steps | 150, effective batch 16 (~1 epoch) |
| Context | 8,192 |
| Hardware | Tesla T4 16GB, free tier |
| Wall clock | 5.05 h at 594.9 tok/s, peak 6.78 GB VRAM |

That is the whole point of the constraint: a usable adapter off one free Kaggle
session, with room to spare on a 16GB card.

### The first evaluation was inconclusive

A base-vs-tuned run on 40 held-out div2 A/B problems returned pass@1 of 0.050
for **both** models. **That delta means nothing and should not be quoted.** The
two models were not measured on comparable terms:

| verdict | base | tuned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no_code` | 0 | **28** |
| `wrong_answer` | 31 | 10 |
| `runtime_error` | 7 | 0 |
| `accepted` | 2 | 2 |

The tuned model produced no code at all on 70% of problems. The base model on
none of them. Same problems, same prompt, same decoding, same 4,096-token
budget.

The training data is the cause. Traces in `codeforces-cots` have a median of
~13,770 estimated tokens, so the fine-tune was taught to reason at length and
was then given 4,096 tokens to do it in. It gets cut off mid-reasoning and
scores as producing nothing.

- **Can be said:** training made the model substantially more verbose, and at
  this budget verbosity dominates everything else.
- **Cannot be said:** whether the fine-tune is better or worse than the base
  model. The measurement does not support a comparison in either direction.

Full write-up in [`results/2026-08-19-eval-easy/`](results/2026-08-19-eval-easy/).

**Next:** re-run with a generation budget measured from what the tuned model
actually emits, rather than guessed at. The previous budget was raised from
3,072 to 4,096 on exactly this reasoning without checking the real distribution,
which papered over a roughly 3x shortfall with a 33% increase.

### The number that goes in the README

Baseline and fine-tune, same 100 held-out problems, same prompt, greedy decoding.

| Model | pass@1 | pass@5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct (base) | — | — |
| Ladder-3B | — | — |

Reproduce with:

```bash
ladder eval --config configs/ladder-3b-t4.yaml                                  # base
ladder eval --config configs/ladder-3b-t4.yaml --adapter outputs/ladder-3b-t4   # tuned
```

Held-out problems are selected by hashing the problem id with the training seed,
so the eval set is exactly the split that data prep withheld. It is not a
separate sample that might overlap with training.

That is an argument, so there is also a check:

```bash
python scripts/check_contamination.py --config configs/ladder-3b-kaggle.yaml --data data/sft
```

It compares the built training set against the problems the eval harness would
actually load, and fails on any overlap. It also compares *aliases*: Codeforces
cross-posts problems between divisions, so `1149/C` and `1150/E` are one problem
under two ids that hash to different sides of the split. In
`solutions_py_decontaminated` that is harmless — 1000 sampled rows had 1000
unique ids and no alias present as its own row — but that is a property of the
dataset, not of the pipeline, and a different source could break it quietly.

Every run's artifacts are committed under [`results/`](results/), so a published
number can be checked by someone who was not there.

## Design notes

**Why 3B.** A 16GB T4 fits a 3B base in 4-bit with an 8192-token context and room
for activations. 7B fits only by cutting context to about 2048, which truncates
most reasoning traces in this dataset — the wrong trade for a task whose training
signal *is* the reasoning.

**Why traces get dropped, not truncated.** A trace longer than `max_tokens` is
discarded. Truncating it would teach the model to stop mid-thought, which is a
worse failure than never seeing the example.

**Why the length bound costs so much data.** These are R1-style reasoning traces
and they are long — median ~13,770 estimated tokens across the corpus, p90
~23,400. Measured yield:

| `max_tokens` | rows kept |
| --- | --- |
| 5,120 | 1,348 (17%) |
| 8,192 | 2,412 (30%) |
| 16,384 | 4,753 (58%) |
| 24,576 | 7,635 (94%) |

8192 is roughly the most a 3B in 4-bit can hold on a 16GB T4 or P100 with room
for activations, so most of the corpus is out of reach on free-tier hardware.
That is a real limitation of this project, not a tuning choice. Sample the
distribution before changing the bound — an earlier config used 5,120 based on
25 rows read from offset 0, which are easy early problems with a median near
2,700 and representative of nothing.

**Why the split is a hash.** `split_key(problem_id, seed)` is stable across runs,
machines, and upstream dataset refreshes. Shuffling with a seed is not: add rows
upstream and a held-out problem can quietly migrate into training.

**Why dedup by problem.** The corpus has several traces per problem. Without
dedup, the same problem lands in both sides of the split and the eval reports a
number that is partly memorization.

**Why the eval skips `checker` problems.** Their output is not unique — `no` and
`NO` are both right, and so is any valid arrangement. Exact-match scoring reports
correct solutions as wrong on them, which would drag every pass@k number down for
a reason that has nothing to do with the model. `EvalConfig.problem_types`
controls this.

**Why output comparison is case-insensitive.** Codeforces accepts `Yes`, `yes`
and `YES` interchangeably, and reference solutions genuinely do print a different
case than the expected-output file. The tolerance is limited to purely alphabetic
tokens, so a grid line like `C.C.C` is still compared exactly.

**Why fp16 and not bf16.** T4 and P100 are pre-Ampere and have no bf16 units.
`train/sft.py` picks based on `torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()`, so the same
config runs on a T4 and on an A100.

## Security

`eval/sandbox.py` executes model-generated code. It runs each program in a
subprocess with a wall-clock timeout, POSIX rlimits on address space, process
count, and file size, in an isolated interpreter (`-I -S`) and a temp directory.

**This is a robustness boundary, not a security boundary.** It stops an
accidental infinite loop or a 20GB allocation. It does not stop deliberately
hostile code, which can still reach the filesystem and the network. Run evals
inside a container or a disposable VM. Kaggle and Colab already give you one,
which is the environment this is designed for.
