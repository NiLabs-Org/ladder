"""Kaggle kernel entry point: preflight -> data -> base eval -> train -> tuned eval.

Runs unattended in one kernel session, so it is written to survive being killed:
every stage writes its result to /kaggle/working/status.json the moment it
finishes, and the adapter is checkpointed as it trains. A session that dies
during the tuned eval still leaves the base number and the adapter behind.

Stage order is deliberate. The base eval runs BEFORE training because a tuned
number with nothing to compare it to is not a result, and the base eval is the
cheapest stage to lose if the clock runs out.
